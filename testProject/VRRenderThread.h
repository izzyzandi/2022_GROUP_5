/**		@file VRRenderThread.h
  *
  *		The following code depicts the header file for the class "VRRenderThread"  which is inherited from the QThread Class.
  *     The code allows one to run a parallel thread to the main thread for the QT framework.
  *     The class is designed in a format to handle the rendering of 3D visualization using VTTK libraries and OpenVR
  *     The class incooroated many private memeber variables whichi is used for the rendering, interaction with the window, camera and a group of actors.
  *     The use of the mutex and wait condition allows the data to be passed smoothing between the threads.
  *     The class also has several public functions: constructor, deconstructor, function to add more actors
  *     Additionally, the class also hasa  list of several commands which xan be issued to the thread to allow the model to rotate along the three coordinate - planes
