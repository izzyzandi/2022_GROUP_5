Vrbindings 

This sub directory contains a set of .json files that define input mappings for virtual reality (VR) controllers. These bindings determine how physical inputs on VR controllers are translated into actions within a VR environment. 


Usage 
To use these bindings in a VR application, simply copy the desired .json file(s) into the appropriate directory within your application. The exact location and naming convention for this directory may vary depending on the specific VR platform and development environment you are using.
Once the .json file(s) have been added to your project, you can load them at runtime and use them to map physical inputs to actions within your application.
